            AAPL stock</h1>
        <p>Link to Github Repo: <a
                href="https://github.com/abdullahahsann/AAPL-Stock-Prediction-Using-LSTM" target="_blank">https://github.com/abdullahahsann/AAPL-Stock-Prediction-Using-LSTM</a>
        </p>
        <p>So this was just a testing project that i did to test out LSTM.</p>
        <p>The data used is real though and is downlaoded from: <a
                href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history?p=AAPL">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history?p=AAPL</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The data is from 2017-09-20 to 2022-09-15.</p>
        <p>First i downloaded the data as csv file from the link shared above. Then i used pandas to read the csv file.
        </p>

                alt="dataload"></p>
        <p>Using matplotlib i plotted the data to see how it looks like. As it can be seen the stocks price are
            increasing over time.</p>
        <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62840383/191893635-18472c6e-a539-4a61-9963-6cabd6947442.png"
                alt="data_visual"></p>
        <p>That is going to be enough for training our model.Zooming in on just the last data points give us a more
            clear picture of how the data looks like.</p>
        <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62840383/191893642-62b02b3b-db53-4632-b6c2-bd1c0d7c591a.png"
                alt="last20data"></p>
        <p>As we are dealing with stock market data. It’s best to convert the graph into a candlestick graph.</p>
        <p>A candlestick has four main components (open, close, high &amp; low price) for a given time period, usually
            within a day. The color (usually green) indicates that the security closed higher than it opened, while the
            other color (usually red) indicates that the security closed lower than it opened.</p>
        <p>For that i used potly library.</p>
        <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62840383/191893661-c1629bf2-74bf-47af-b7fb-f0e029770401.png"
                alt="candle1"></p>
        <p>Candlestick with moving averages of 30 and 50 peroiods…</p>
        <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62840383/191893665-87b0154d-c3ae-4e3a-badb-814936bdade8.png"
                alt="candle2"></p>
        <p>This is the LSTM model. Quite a straighforward one but one that will get the job done.</p>
        <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62840383/191893681-8373e0fd-ae90-4a70-ab9a-7defc94bbeaf.png"
                alt="model"></p>
        <p>After all the data preprocessing and model training we get the following results.</p>
        <p>(The model was trained for 10 epochs and acheived a RMSE of 1.788)</p>
        <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62840383/191893697-f1663c9d-dcaa-4b5d-adb2-0ab396dd846d.png"
                alt="results"></p>
        <p>Quite a good result i would say for just being trained for 10 epochs.</p>
        <p>Below a numerical comparison of the predicted and actual values shows that though in he world of stock market
            predictions, the model is not perfect (as even a difference of some cents can cost a lot, and here the model
            does deviate by a dollar at most places while even by 5 at others) but still as we can see by the graph if
            we were to use it to generate a future prediction it would very well give quite a good trend and that to me
            is quite mesemerizing.</p>
